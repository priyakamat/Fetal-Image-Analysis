A comprehensive deep-learning framework for fetal ultrasound analysis. Its main novelty is a trimester-aware approach that uses a denoising autoencoder for preprocessing, an ensemble of seven models for robust segmentation of head circumference (HC) and femur length (FL), and a novel "multi-input" DenseNet121 network for trimester classification.
The work carried out on the public HC18 dataset also created a custom dataset with Head circumference (HC), Femur Length(FL). This custom dataset well-annotated dataset with trimester-specific labels for both HC and FL.
